# epigraph-configurator-starter
Aims to be a starting point for setting up the epigraph-configurator web component on a webpage. 
Each scenario would be different but this repository should give a clear idea of what the process looks like.


## Instructions to run this on your machine:
1. Install an extension of your choice in your IDE to launch either "index-customUI.html" or "index-defaultUI.html", depending on your usage.
2. If the extension that you are using, launches the browser automatically, make sure to replace your local address with "localhost" for eg. "http://127.0.0.1:5500/building-custom-ui/index-customUI.html" would become "http://localhost:5500/building-custom-ui/index-customUI.html"


> IMPORTANT: Make sure to run this on "http://localhost" (it won't work on your local address).
